sidebar 
- stop using findPositionInFile() - as its not accurate
- preview popup - can it position to location in document?
- embed/blocks displayed in pane should include full reference (not just the originating document) - hopefully will help with preview
- can we integrate graph view
- provide a preview of the link


Block id in preview mode not reendering its count, though working in live preview. Example:
# Heading 1
- Heading 1, line 1 ^nibi88   <---- Problem here
- Heading 1, line 2
- Heading 1, line 3
